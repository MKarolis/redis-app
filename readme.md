<h2>Database structure</h2>
- Libraries, books and users are stored as hashes in form of `[entityType]||[entityId]`, 
for instance `book||1` or `user||2`
- Special key `lookup||user||[userName]` is used to lookup user id by his userName
- Keys `bookcount||[libraryId]` are used to store hashes of book counts in a library. 
Each field of the hash is book's id, value - book count.
- Keys `bookstaken||[userId]` are used to store hashes of books that a user has taken.
 Each field of the hash is book's id, value - book count.
- Keys `ticker||[entityType]` are used to store how many entities of each type are present.
